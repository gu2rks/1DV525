### Part 1 - HTML and structure

<p>In this part we are going to start working with HTML and structure our web site</p>
<p><strike>The web site should at least contain one landing page (start page) and three (3) sub pages. You should be able to click around the site trough a menu that is always present on every page. See image 1.1 below.</strike></p>
<p>The minimum subpages should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strike>About- This page should contain some text about your self (if you want - a fictional person). This page should contain at least:
<ul>
<li>One ordered list (maybe list favorite movies, songs or things like that)</li>
<li>One unordered list</li>
<li>One image (relative URL to the image)</li>
<li>One playable video element (find one on the net and use an external URL)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Blog/news - This page should contain at least two blog posts build by using <a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/html5/new-tags-in-html5.html">the &quot;new&quot; HTML5 tags</a></li>
<li>
<p>Contact - This page should contain a correct HTML form supporting HTTP POST method. For more information se image 1.2 below. There are no requirement that the form works since we haven't got a backend. We want you just to make it in HTML.</p>
</li>
<li>All sub pages should be available through a menu that should be present in every page.
For more information see image 1.1 below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Think about</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you structure or files and folders in a good way. Maybe one folder for images, one for pages, one for stylesheets and so on...</li>
<li>Think of the semantic meaning of the page elements and their order</li>
</ul>
</strike>

<h2>Part 2 - CSS</h2>
<p><strike>Now it is time to style your HTML pages. All CSS should be in separate files and be linked into the document. The web site layout should be like image 2.1, a simple three-column layout.You are free to choose colors and text font but you should put some time and love into the design.</p></strike>

<h3>Some more requirements</h3>
<ul>
<strike><li>All pages should have a link to the CSS rules to get a consistent feeling.</li>
<li>All pages content should be centered when you resize your web browser window.</li>
<li>The links (at least in the menu) should have some hover effect (feel free to experiment)</li>
<li>Use CSS to include at least one background image</li>
</ul></strike>
<h2>Part 3 - other stuff</h2>
<ul>
<strike><li>You should use open graph for easy sharing on social media. You should at least use &quot;title&quot;, &quot;url&quot;, &quot;type&quot; and &quot;image&quot;. You can check if it is working by sharing your site on for instance Facebook or Twitter. You should use open graph for easy sharing on social media. 
<li>Learn about and create a robots.txt for your site. The contact page should not be indexed by search engines</li>
<li>Learn about and create a humans.txt for your site</li></strike>
</ul>
