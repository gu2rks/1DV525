                    <h2>What is Robots.txt file?</h2>
                    <details>
                        <summary>The robots.txt file is a simple text file placed on your web server which tells
                            webcrawlers (Googlebot) if they should access a file or not. </summary>
                        <br><br>
                        I have a robots.txt at my root web directory (https://1dv525.github.io/aa224iu-examination-1). I
                        block Googlebot to access to contact.html as the assignment required. Also, I chose to block the
                        bot to access my pictures by <mark>Disallow: /images/</mark>
                        , which mean block Google bot to access images directory + all children file/directory that
                        exits inside the"images" directory Why? because why not? It is my images anyway :P
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>But wait</strong>, Googlebot is not the only webcrawler that exits on the internet.
                        Then I decided to create another group and as a <mark>User-agent: *</mark>, which mean block all
                        other webcrawler to access images directory too

                        Same case as robots.txt, humans.txt is stored at my web directory. Not much to say, since it is
                        only me that build this website up, using my clean+simple design. Check it out if you wanna know

                    <h2>What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?</h2>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Open Graph is a protocol that created by Facebook that aim for sharing information
                            about the website in a simple way by using metadata type</summary>
                        I'm using all basic metadata that is require for this assignment. Such as, title, type, url and
                        image. I implemented OpenGraph to all pages with different content on each page. So check it
                        out! share all my pages !!!

                    <h2>Why is it important to seperate the layout and design (css) from content (html)?</h2>
                    <details>
                        <summary>my answer is WHY DO YOU WANT TO MESS UP YOUR CODE and give yourself a headache?
                        </summary>
                        Just kidding tho, one important benifit is <strong>NO code duplication</strong>. Assume that you
                        have an h1 tag
                        that uses the same style in each page. If you have the css and html in the save file means that
                        you have to rewrite the same css all over again. What if you have 100 pages? DAMN !! you will
                        need to change it in all 100 pages just because you might want to change from front-color red to
                        blue, <strong>soooo painful</strong>.
                        <br><br>
                        there are so many reason, it will take me 5 pages to write about it. So you go Google it. It is
                        a hot topic out there.

                    <h2>IOS users have been hack for years by visiting a hecked website</h2>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Hacker use vulnerability in the Safari web-browser to gain root access</summary>
                        <br><br>
                        Early this year, a Google researcher explained how some of the IOS users might have been hack by
                        just visit a hacked site.
                        Hacker uses the vulnerability in the Safari web-browser to gain root access to their devices.
                        <br><br>
                        The iPhone exploits were used to deploy and implant (spyware) which are design to steal files
                        such as <mark>iMessages, photos, and live GPS location data of users, and upload them to an
                            external server every 60 seconds</mark>. The implant also had access to the victim's
                        device's keychain data containing credentials, authentication tokens, and certificates used on
                        and by the device.
                        <br><br>
                        <em>"The best part"</em> is the implant will automatically wipe off from an infected iPhone upon
                        rebooting and leaving no trace of itself. The implant will be reinstalled only if the user
                        visiting the hacked site again. <br>

                    <h2>IT security incident.</h2>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Some stream website use my laptop to mine cryptocurrency</summary>
                        <br><br>
                        Game of Thrones, a famous series that everyone talks about it. I kinda like it because it is one
                        of the few series that can keep surprising me the whole time. Early this was its last season, I
                        was so hype since it would be the end om the series (at least for tv-show version). Also, I HATE
                        when I excedent sees a spoil on social media. To avoid this trouble, I tried to watch it as soon
                        as I could.
                        <br><br>
                        At some point, I end up watching it on a website that I haven't visited before. The website
                        looks decent, the quality of the series was really good. So I thought "Why not? I need to watch
                        it before someone spoil me anyway". During the epic fight between human and the dead, my laptop
                        started to make to much noise. That noise that you usually hear when your computer is working at
                        high capacity. "What the... ?" I paused the series and try to find the cause of it. I remember
                        that I was so pissed that I needed to pause the series in the middle of the great fight. I
                        checked my task manager, my CPU was working at high capacity. "But how?" I asked myself. I don't
                        have anything running more than Firefox.
                        <br><br>
                        "Never mind let's watch it first and find out what is going on later", said the voices in my
                        head. Yes, I did listen to that stupid voice. It always gets me to do stupid stuff. So I watched
                        the whole epic fight with the fan noise in the background, which tires to cool my CPU down.
                        <br><br>
                        I did some research after I finish that episode (GG Arya heart). The website has been using my
                        CPU to "mine" a cryptocurrency. But after the incident, I have been using "No coin" to block all
                        mining script. (NoScript couldn't help me since I need to inactivate it when I want to watch the
                        series).
